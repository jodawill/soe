soe - System of Equations Solver
================================
             Current Web Home: https://github.com/jodawill/soe

soe is a free utility to solve systems of equations. It will prompt the
user for the co efficients in each equation and the right-hand sides then
use Gaussian elimination to solve for the unknowns.

When run with the -v (verbose) option, it will display the steps it used
to solve the equations.

INSTALLATION
============

To compile, simply type `make` into the terminal. Provided you have a
working installation of gcc in your path, it will place the executable
in the top level directory.

BUGS AND FEATURE REQUEST
========================
Please report bugs to the maintainer, Joshua Williams <jodawill@iuk.edu>.
Before requesting a feature, read the TODO file to make sure it isn't
already planned for a future release. Of course, patches are always welcome.
